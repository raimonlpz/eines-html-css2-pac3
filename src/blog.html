                    Trap music employs multilayered thin- or thick-textured monophonic drones with sometimes a melodic accompaniment expressed with synthesizers; crisp, grimy, and rhythmic snares, deep 808 kick drums, double-time, triple-time, and similarly divided hi-hats, and a cinematic and symphonic use of string, brass, woodwind, and keyboard instruments to create an energetic, hard-hitting, deep, and variant atmosphere.

                            deals are made, who along with Mannie Fresh from New Orleans and DJ Paul
                            from Memphis, Tennessee worked with local acts in Atlanta.

                            During the early- to mid-2000s, trap music began to emerge as a recognized
                            genre after the mainstream success of a number of albums and singles with
                            lyrics that covered life in "the trap", drug dealing and the struggle for success.

                            peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.

                        In 2015, a new fusion of trap music named as "Latin trap" began to emerge.
                        Latin trap is similar to mainstream trap which details "'la calle', or the
                        streets—hustling, sex, and drugs...
                        Prominent artists of Latin trap include Bryant Myers, Anuel AA, Miky Woodz,
                        Almighty, Maluma and Bad Bunny.
